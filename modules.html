Level&nbsp;3 Core is usable in its own right (much like SBML Levels&nbsp;1
and&nbsp;2 before it), and optional SBML Level&nbsp;3 <em>Packages</em> add
features to this Core.  To support this architecture, libSBML is itself
divided into a core libSBML and optional extensions.


<h2>Differences between core libSBML and extensions to libSBML </h2>

<p> Core libSBML corresponds to the features of SBML Levels&nbsp;1 to&nbsp;3
Core; they are always available, and require applications to understand only
the SBML core specifications.  The classes listed on the rest of this page
constitute libSBML's implementation of SBML Levels 1&ndash;3,
<em>without</em> any SBML Level&nbsp;3 packages.

<p> By contrast, the libSBML extensions are plug-ins that each implement
support for a given SBML Level&nbsp;3 package.  Separate pages of this API
manual describe the libSBML extensions for those SBML Level&nbsp;3 packages
that are supported at this time.  They are grouped under the section titled
<a href="usergroup0.html">Level 3 Extensions</a>.  The stable releases of
libSBML only include extensions for officially-released package
specifications; additional, experimental extensions may be available for
other Level&nbsp;3 packages that may not yet have been finalized by the SBML
community.  You can find copies of these experimental extensions at the <a
target="_blank" href="http://sf.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml">download
site for libSBML on SourceForge.net</a>.


<h2>Summary of core SBML objects implemented in libSBML </h2>

<p>Each type of component in a plain SBML model (i.e., one that does not use
any SBML packages) is described using a specific type of SBML data object
that organizes the relevant information.  The top level of an SBML model
definition consists of lists of these components, with every list being
optional.  The next table enumerates the lists and objects defined by core
SBML; also shown are the SBML Level+Version combinations for which they are
valid.

Level&nbsp;3 <em>Flux Balance Constraints</em> package.  It can be used in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 and Version&nbsp;2 documents.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> Constraint based modeling is a widely accepted methodology used to analyze
and study biological networks on both a small and whole organism (genome)
scale. Typically these models are underdetermined and constraint based
methods (e.g. linear, quadratic optimization) are used to optimize specific
model properties. This is assumed to occur under a defined set of constraints
(e.g. stoichiometric, metabolic) and bounds (e.g. thermodynamic, experimental
and environmental) on the values that the solution fluxes can obtain.

<p> Perhaps the most well known (and widely used) analysis method is Flux
Balance Analysis (FBA), which is performed on Genome Scale
Reconstructions. When using FBA, a target flux is optimized (e.g., to
maximize a flux to biomass or minimize ATP production) while other fluxes can
be bounded to simulate a selected growth environment or specific metabolic
state.

<p> As constraint based models are generally underdetermined, i.e., few or
none of the kinetic rate equations and related parameters are known, it is
crucial that a model definition includes the ability to define optimization
parameters such as objective functions, flux bounds and constraints.  This is
not well-supported in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.  The question of how to best
encode constraint-based models in SBML is not new.  However, advances in the
methods used to construct genome scale constraint-based models and the wider
adoption of constraint based modeling in biotechnological/medical
applications have led to a rapid increase in both the number of models being
constructed and the tools used to analyze them.

<p> Faced with such growth, both in number and diversity, the need for a
standardized data format for the definition, exchange and annotation of
constraint based models has become critical. As the core model components
(e.g., species, reactions, stoichiometry) can already be efficiently
described in SBML, the Flux Balance Constraints (FBC) package is designed to
extend SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core by adding the elements necessary to encode current
and future constraint-based models.

<p> In version 2 of this package, the ability to encode gene products and
gene product references was added, and the encoding of flux bounds was modified
to reference parameters, instead of holding directly-encoded values.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The SBML Level&nbsp;3 Groups package offers a more flexible mechanism for indicating that components of an SBML model are related in some way.  The nature of the relationship is left up to the modeler, and can be clarified by means of annotations on model components.  Groups may contain either the same or different types of SBML objects, and groups may be nested if desired.  There are no predefined behavioral semantics associated with groups.

The term <em>groups</em> is used in this package rather than <em>types</em>, because the latter would imply stronger behavioral constraints on objects than what Groups provides. This package only provides a way of conceptually grouping components of a model.  It does not provide a way to define types in the computer science sense; therefore, a different term is appropriate.

<em>Hierarchical Model Composition</em> package.  It can be used in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 and Version&nbsp;2 documents.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> In the context of SBML, <em>hierarchical model composition</em> refers to
the ability to include models as submodels inside another model. The goal is
to support the ability of modelers and software tools to do such things as
(1) decompose larger models into smaller ones, as a way to manage complexity;
(2) incorporate multiple instances of a given model within one or more
enclosing models, to avoid literal duplication of repeated elements; and (3)
create libraries of reusable, tested models, much as is done in software
development and other engineering fields. SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core, by
itself, has no direct support for allowing a model to include other models as
submodels.  The Level&nbsp;3 Hierarchical Model Composition package adds the
missing capabilities.  The figure below illustrates some of the scenarios
targeted by this package.

SBML Level&nbsp;3 <em>Layout</em> package.  It can be used in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 and Version&nbsp;2 documents.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The layout of a reaction network diagram should be described as a graphical
representation of species and reactions, and not as an arbitrary drawing or
graph. This means that existing languages for the description of vector
drawings (SVG) or general graphs cannot be used.  While it may seem
unnecessary to invent a new language when an existing one like SVG could in
principle be used to describe the layout of a reaction network, there are
good reasons to have a language tailored specifically for the layout of SBML
models.  Presumably, most programs that will use this SBML extension are
primarily programs dealing with biochemical models. Internally, they will
have data structures for species and reactions, so it will be natural for
them to describe the layout of the reaction network also in terms of species
and reactions (and not in terms of, e.g., polygons or splines). Thus, the
<b>LayoutClass</b> object defined by this SBML Layout package has a similar
structure like the SBML <b>Model</b> object and contains lists of graphical
representations of compartments, species, and reactions.  Additional layout
elements and relationships can be represented by using other custom objects
defined by this package.

<center>
<figure>
<img src="layout-example.png">
<figcaption>Example of different renderings of the same layout.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p> Another important question is the level of detail that the description
should provide. For simplicity, only the layout (i.e., the position of the
different graphical objects) of the diagram is encoded, not the details of
how it should be rendered; the latter is left to the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Render
package.  The figure at right illustrates this distinction. All three
diagrams could be renderings of the same layout and would be described by
identical SBML files. No information about colors, line styles, fonts, etc.,
is present in the layout description.

<p> The next question is how the relation between the model and the layout 
should be established. There seems to be a consensus that one model 
element can be represented by several layout elements. For example, it 
can be useful to have several representations of one species in the 
layout to avoid crossing lines. This can be accomplished if every layout 
element has a field that refers to the id of a model element. 

<p> There are also cases where a layout element does not correspondent to 
exactly one model element. One example is when a layout shows a 
simplified version of a model in which one reaction in the layout 
corresponds to several reactions and intermediate species in the model. 
This is the reason why the field in the layout elements that refers to 
the model elements is optional: to allow layout objects that do not have 
a specific counterpart in the SBML model. 

<p> The result of all this is a way to describe the graphical layout of a 
reaction network in biochemical terms. This layout can be closely tied 
to the model. A graphical editor, for example, would 
typically create a layout that is closely connected (by a one-to-several 
relation from the model elements to the layout elements) to the model. 
A more general layout design program could create a layout that is 
not so closely tied to the model; for example, it could create a layout 
that shows a simplified version of the model. 


<h2>Historical considerations</h2>

<p> Historically, the SBML Layout package has been used to encode the layout
of SBML Level&nbsp;2 models; indeed, the original version of the package was
developed in the context of SBML Level&nbsp;2.  The approach used with
Level&nbsp;2 is to store the layout information as SBML annotations, i.e.,
using SBML <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> elements.  The following XML
namespace must be used for layout annotations in Level&nbsp;2 models:

<center>
<code>http://projects.eml.org/bcb/sbml/level2</code>
</center>

<p> A minimal example in this case would look like the following:

<pre class="fragment">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2" level="2" version="1"&gt;
  &lt;model&gt;
    &lt;annotation&gt;
      &lt;listOfLayouts xmlns="http://projects.eml.org/bcb/sbml/level2"&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/listOfLayouts&gt;
    &lt;/annotation&gt;
  &lt;/model&gt;
&lt;/sbml&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Special libSBML behavior for Level&nbsp;2 Layout</h3>

<p> Due to the way that the encoding difference discussed above affects
legacy applications, libSBML implements special behavior for the Layout
package: it <em>always</em> creates a Layout plugin object for any SBML
Level&nbsp;2 document it reads in, regardless of whether that document
actually uses Layout constructs.  This is unlike the case for SBML
Level&nbsp;3 documents that use Layout&mdash;for them, libSBML will
<em>not</em> create a plugin object unless the document actually declares the
use of the Layout package (via the usual Level&nbsp;3 namespace declaration
for Level&nbsp;3 packages).

<p>
This has the following consequence.  If an application queries for the
presence of Layout in an SBML Level&nbsp;2 document by testing only for
the existence of the plugin object, <strong>it will always get a positive
result</strong>; in other words, the presence of a Layout extension
object is not an indication of whether a read-in Level&nbsp;2 document
does or does not use SBML Layout.  Instead, callers have to query
explicitly for the existence of layout information.

<p> The special, always-available Level&nbsp;2 Layout behavior was motivated
by a desire to support legacy applications.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the Layout
package uses the normal SBML Level&nbsp;3 scheme of requiring declarations on
the SBML document element.  This means that upon reading a model, libSBML
knows right away whether it contains layout information.  In SBML
Level&nbsp;2, there is no top-level declaration because layout is stored as
annotations in the body of the model.  Detecting the presence of layout
information when reading a Level&nbsp;2 model requires parsing the
annotations.  For efficiency reasons, libSBML normally does not parse
annotations automatically when reading a model.  However, applications that
predated the introduction of Level&nbsp;3 Layout and the updated version of
libSBML never had to do anything special to enable parsing layout; the
facilities were always available for every Level&nbsp;2 model as long as
libSBML was compiled with Layout support.  To avoid burdening developers of
legacy applications with the need to modify their software, libSBML provides
backward compatibility by always preloading the Layout package extension when
reading Level&nbsp;2 models.  The same applies to the creation of
Level&nbsp;2 models: with the plugin-oriented libSBML, applications normally
would have to take deliberate steps to activate package code, instantiate
objects, manage namespaces, and so on.  LibSBML again loads the Layout
package plugin automatically when creating a Level&nbsp;2 model, thereby
making the APIs available to legacy applications without further work on
their part.

<h3>Testing for Level&nbsp;2 Layout</h3>

The following are examples of code fragments that could be used to test for
the presence of layout data in a Level&nbsp;2 model.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The SBML Level&nbsp;3 Multistate, Multicomponent and Multicompartment Species (multi) package provides an extension of SBML Level&nbsp;3 that supports encoding models with molecular complexes that have multiple components and can exist in multiple states and in multiple compartments. One of its goals also is to provide a platform for sharing models based on the specifications of bimolecular interactions and the rules governing such interactions.  In addition, this specification includes features to support multicompartment species (species that are described as residing in more than one compartment).

<h2>Authors</h2>

The primary authors of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Multistate, Multicomponent and Multicompartment Species specification are Fenkgai Zhang and Martin Meier-Schellersheim.

Level&nbsp;3 <em>Qualitative Models</em> package.  It can be used in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 and Version&nbsp;2 documents.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> Quantitative methods for modeling biological networks require an
in-depth knowledge of the biochemical reactions and their stoichiometric and
kinetic parameters. In many practical cases, this knowledge is missing. This
has led to the development of several qualitative modeling methods using
information such as gene expression data coming from functional genomic
experiments.

<p> The qualitative models contemplated in this SBML Level&nbsp;3 package for
<em>Qualitative Models</em> are essentially based on the definition of
<em>regulatory</em> or <em>influence graphs</em>. The components of these
models differ from the species and reactions used in current SBML models. For
example, qualitative models typically associate discrete levels of activities
with entity pools; the processes involving them cannot be described as
reactions per se but rather as transitions between states. These systems can
be viewed as reactive systems, whose dynamics are represented by means of
state transition graphs (or other Kripke structures representing, in the form
of a graph, which nodes are the reachable states and in which the edges are
the state transitions). In this context, logical regulatory networks (Boolean
or multi-valued) and standard Petri nets are the two formalisms mostly used
in biology that give rise to such behaviors. Published models using these
approaches cover, far from exhaustively, gene regulatory networks, signalling
pathways and metabolic pathways.

<p> Despite differences from traditional SBML models, it is desirable to
bring these classes of models under a common format scheme. The purpose of
this Qualitative Models package for SBML Level&nbsp;3 is to support encoding
qualitative models in SBML.

Level&nbsp;3 <em>Graphical Rendering</em> ("render") package.  It can be used

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The graphical depiction of a reaction network diagram should be described
  as graphical representations of species and reactions, and not as arbitrary
  drawing or graph.  While it may seem unnecessary to invent a new language
  when an existing one like SVG could in principle be used to describe the
  layout of a reaction network, there are good reasons to have a language
  tailored specifically for the layout of SBML models.  For example, most
  programs that will use this SBML extension are primarily programs dealing
  with biochemical models.  Internally, they will have data structures for
  species and reactions, so it will also be natural for them to depict the
  reaction network in terms of species and reactions (and not in terms of,
  e.g., polygons or splines).

  <p> The Graphical Rendering ("render") package for SBML Level&nbsp;3 is a
  companion to the Graphical Layout ("layout") package.  Together, they
  provide a complete format for describing the layout of a diagram
  and the visual rendition of the entities within it.
